**Since now Promise is implemented by all most every Javascript platform, there is no need to struggle using which Promise. If you dont care about the runtime speed, use native Promise which no need to require a new module. Or if you want more feature, use [bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) with 50KB. Or if you want smaller size, use Yaku(https://github.com/ysmood/yaku) with 4.1KB. This repo is for understanding Promise cencept. Dont use it.**
