### Overview

Just a Promises/A+ spec implementation Project. Readable, simple, but not useful to production.


### Why I name mimi

In Chinese, mimi means breast. Since when I write code, I always think about mimi to let me focus. So I name it to express my thought to mimi. May god bless mimi.

### Test
